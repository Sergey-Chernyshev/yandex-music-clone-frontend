## About this project
The idea of creating this project came to me when I was choosing a new Pet project for myself. In addition, I have long wanted to make my own implementation of syncing music between different devices, even outside the same account. I am solving this problem with this project. Using the api, which is available in Python, I get all the data about the user and display it on my site.

## Project goal
Create a more optimized modern web application. Explore new technologies.
